This project extracts product data for dresses listed on Amazon using Python and BeautifulSoup. The extracted data includes product name, price, ratings, and customer reviews.

#### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for web scraping.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook provided an interactive environment for running and testing our scraping script. It allowed us to execute code cells iteratively, visualize data, and make necessary adjustments to the scraping logic.
- **MS Excel**: Microsoft Excel was used for saving the scraped data. We exported the extracted data to Excel spreadsheets for further analysis and easy interpretation.
